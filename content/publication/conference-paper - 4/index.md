# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we propose an approach for revealing component descriptors, component instances and component based architecture to materialize the recovered architecture of an object oriented software in component based languages. We applied our solution onto two well known component based languages, OSGi and SOFA.
